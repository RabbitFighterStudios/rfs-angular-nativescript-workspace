# RFS Angular/Nativescript Workspace

Workspace meant to house projects that relate to MIDI and software/hardware design, development, and integration, but for now, expploring the initial challenge of getting the best out of Angular 17+ and the native requirements and features from NativeScript, while having a reliable and accurate state management system in NgRx, as well as deployment and CI/CD options. For now it is just a miracle to get this all set up and running. Will update as I go.

## Tech Stack and reasoning

A combination of Angular 17+ with NativeScript 8+ alongside NgRx state management proves invaluable, offering a robust set of features tailored to meet a serious development team's needs.

My approach involves harnessing Angularâ€™s Dependency Injection (DI), expressive directives, control flow templating, and reactive view bindings to seamlessly integrate with iOS CoreMIDI (to start) using NativeScript, thereby actualizing the UI and advanced functionalities. I also plan to use other NativeScript UI Components via the SwiftUI library and others.

## Tech Stack:

Below is a list of eventual technologies that will be explored:

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for styling platform-optimized views via NativeScript.
- **State Management**: Implemented using NgRx 17.x.
- **SQLite**: Employed for local offline database functionalities.
- **Supabase**: Utilized for remote syncable database operations.
- **Mobile UI Testing**: Conducted with Maestro.

## Nx plugins and code generators

These are just examples...

Add Nx plugins to leverage their code generators and automated, inferred tasks.

```
# Add plugin
npx nx add @nx/react

# Use code generator
npx nx generate @nx/react:app demo

# Run development server
npx nx serve demo

# View project details
npx nx show project demo --web
```

Run `npx nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [code generators](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code) and [inferred tasks](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks) in the docs.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
